Solution for a theoretical problem as a cloud engineer(from market analysis to financial analysis to additional capacity planning)

This is the Solution for a theoretical problem given in my institute as Cloud Course project.
The "problem_statement.pdf" file contains problem statement for the project and the expectations for solution of the problem of the project.
The "CC Project Final Report.pdf" file contains the proposed solution for the problem statement, according to the assumptions taken by us(assumptions are stated in the Market Analysis portion of the solution.)

As there couldn't be an ideal solution of this problem statement, this solution is also not an ideal solution, it is according to the assumptions taken.
There could be multiple solutions for this problem statement.
